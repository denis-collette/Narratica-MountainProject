## 1. Project Description
This project is an **audiobook streaming platform** where users can listen to audiobooks, manage favorites, and interact with structured book collections. The application will have different user roles with specific permissions and a modern frontend built with **React**. The backend will be powered by **Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF)** to manage users, audio files, and authentication.

## 2. Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React** (for UI)
- **React Router** (for navigation)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **Axios** (for API requests)
- **React Query** (for data fetching)

### Backend:
- **Django** (Python framework)
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** (for API)
- **PostgreSQL** (or SQLite for development)
- **JWT Authentication** (for user login and permissions)
- **CockroachDB** (considered for hosting, pending decision)
- **Free Audiobook APIs** (exploring options like LibriVox, Open Library)

## 3. Frontend Structure

### **Main Features:**
- **Audio Player**: Always visible across all pages.
- **Homepage**: Displays latest uploads, news from favorite authors, and categorized tags.
- **User Dashboard**: Manage favorites, private playlists, and settings (including dark mode toggle).
- **Author/Publisher Pages**: Managed by users to upload and organize audiobooks (books as playlists, chapters as audio files).
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, content, and system-wide settings.

### **Homepage Details:**
- Displays **latest audiobook uploads**.
- Highlights **news from favorite authors**.
- Includes **tag-based categories** for organizing content.
- **Personalized recommendations** based on user listening history and favorite tags.
- **Search & Filtering**: Users can search by **title, author, or tags** and filter by **multiple tags at once**.

## 4. Backend Structure

### **Key Functionalities:**
- **User Authentication** (Register/Login with JWT, role-based access)
- **Audiobook File Management** (Upload, store, and stream audio files)
- **Playlist & Favorites Management** (Users can create and manage them)
- **Admin Controls** (Manage users and content, approve author pages, moderate audiobooks)
- **Integration with Free Audiobook APIs** (If applicable, these APIs will provide **metadata and external streaming links**.)
- **Caching for External APIs** (To reduce excessive calls and API rate limits.)

### **User Roles & Permissions:**
| Role            | Permissions                                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Guest**       | Listen to extracts of audiobooks, view homepage               |
| **Subscribed User** | Listen to full audiobooks, add favorites (books, authors) |
| **Author/Publisher** | Upload audiobooks, create public playlists (books)       |
| **Admin**       | Manage users, handle CRUD operations, moderate reports        |

## 5. Database Schema

### **Main Tables:**
1. **User** (Django built-in with custom roles)
2. **UserProfile** (Extends User with roles & permissions)
3. **AuthorPage** (Managed by users for uploading content)
4. **AudioFile** (Stores uploaded audio files)
5. **Playlist/Books** (Managed by AuthorPage to organize content with tags)
6. **Tag** (Associated with audiobooks for categorization, min 1, max 3 per book) => .json in src ?
7. **Favorite** (Links users to favorite books or authors)

## 6. API Endpoints

### **Authentication & User Management**
- `POST /api/register/` â†’ Register a new user
- `POST /api/login/` â†’ Authenticate user (JWT token)
- `POST /api/admin/approve-author/` â†’ Approve author pages (Admin only)
- `POST /api/admin/review-reports/` â†’ Handle user-reported content (Admin only)

### **Audiobook File Management**
- `GET /api/audio/` â†’ Get all public audiobooks
- `GET /api/audio/{id}/` â†’ Get full audiobook (if user) or extract (if guest)
- `POST /api/audio/upload/` â†’ Upload audiobook file (Author only)

### **Playlist & Favorites Management**
- `POST /api/playlists/create/` â†’ Create a playlist
- `GET /api/playlists/{id}/` â†’ Get playlist details
- `POST /api/favorites/` â†’ Add an audiobook to favorites

## 7. Roadmap

### **Global Roadmap**
This roadmap follows agile-style iterations to keep things structured.

**ðŸŸ¢ Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning**

â¬œ Review README & Define Scope

âœ… Create GitHub Repository

â¬œ Choose Database Solution (CockroachDB, Free Audiobook APIs, or another option)

â¬œ Gather UI References & Design Discussion

Here is what ChatGPT propose when you ask for an audiobook platform (we can do better!):

![Sketch2](Sketch2.webp "Sketch2")

![Sketch3](Sketch3.webp "Sketch3")


**ðŸŸ¡ Phase 2: Backend & API Development**

â¬œ Set Up Django Project & Dependencies

â¬œ Implement API Endpoints for Users & Audiobooks (with fake DB for front)

â¬œ Define User Roles & Authentication (JWT)

â¬œ Database Schema & Models

â¬œ Audio Upload & Storage Solution

â¬œ Set Up Admin Dashboard Features

â¬œ Test integration of Free Audiobook APIs (if applicable)

**ðŸŸ  Phase 3: Frontend Development**

â¬œ Initialize React Project & Dependencies

â¬œ Build Core UI Components (Audio Player, Navigation, Dark Mode Toggle, etc.)

â¬œ Connect Frontend to API (Authentication, Audio Streaming, etc.)

â¬œ Develop User, Author, and Admin Dashboards

â¬œ Implement search & filtering (by tags, author, etc.)

**ðŸ”µ Phase 4: Testing & Deployment**

â¬œ Test Backend API & Fix Bugs

â¬œ Test Frontend UI & Refine User Experience

â¬œ Implement automated testing (unit tests, integration tests)

â¬œ Optimize for Mobile & Performance Improvements

â¬œ Deploy Application (Potential Hosting: Railway, Render, Vercel, Netlify)
