Resource Management: You can manage AWS resources programmatically, such as creating S3 buckets or uploading files.

High-Level Interface: Simplifies tasks like file uploads, downloads, and metadata handling.

Low-Level Interface: Offers granular control over AWS operations if you need detailed configuration.
